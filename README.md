# angular-skeleton

Just another seed for AngularJS apps.

This project is a skeleton for an [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web application, for simple to complex apps. It is inspired by the projects [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) and (formerly) [ng-boilerplate](https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp).

It defines a customized directory structure, based on the structure suggested by the [Angular Best Practice for App Structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXMvReO8-Awi1EZXAXS4PzDzdNvV6pGcuaF4Q9821Es/pub) document, in an attempt to generalize the structure for applications with any complexity (including room for server-side scripts, mainly in the "resource/script/" directory).
